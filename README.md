## Motivation

Whether we are new graduates or experienced professionals, we may be inclined to try our hand at investing.  The stock market offers a convenient way for us to put our hard-earned cash to work, whether it be buying into technology with some stocks in Apple, or taking a chance in a growth company such as Tesla for some exponential gains. 
 
The drawback, however, is that the stockmarket contains a fair amount of risk, as you can lose your entire investment if a company goes bankrupt and out of existence.  This presents a mental hurdle for a lot of people to start investing.

BootStocks allows users to practice investing in stocks without the threat of losing their real money. This application can help take away some of the fear and anxiety of the stockmarket, and will surely aid anyone in their quest to invest and build their wealth. 


## Project Description

With BootStocks, users can create an account to practice investing with our mock portfolio feature. Users start with $10,000 and can buy/sell stocks, which will update their portfolio, viewed in a table format.  The user can assign categories to each purchased batch of stocks and then sort by category (e.g. high-risk, technology, etc.).  

Each row in the table will show an purchased order (stock symbol and quantity), which can then be categorized, synced with an API call to update gain/loss value, or sold.  Buying and selling stocks will update the user’s money balance.
